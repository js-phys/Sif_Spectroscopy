# Sifx_Evaluation
#### Language: Matlab (and Andor Basic)
Acquisition &amp; Evaluation of spectroscopic data acquired with an Andor CCD camera (Newton)

---

This is a loose collection of software that was used to a) acquire spectroscopic data with an Andor detector and b) evaluate the spectra automatically with Matlab. The acquisition program (a) was written in Andor Basic and can be executed directly in the Andor SOLIS software. It spools spectra fils (.sif) to disc and creates a report file with some metadata. 

This data can be loaded into Matlab for further evaluation (b).

**Note: For proper function the Andor Software Development Kit (SDK) has to be installed first.
